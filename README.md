# Map Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create and use Maps

## Instructions

Convert your list-based library from the previous section into a map-based
library. In your map-based list of books, use the title of the book as the key.
Also add a new option to your loop to support the following functionality:

1. Ask the user if they want to add a book or look up an existing book
2. If they want to look up an existing book, ask them for the title of the book
3. Using the title they enter, look up the book in your map-based list
4. If you find the book, display the book's information and continue your loop
5. If you don't find the book, tell the user your library doesn't have that book
   and continue your loop
